# pycubed_docs_learning
A repository to practice PyCubed Commands, functions, on a few wireboards. Msotly tinkering with the software side of PyCubed. Currently focusing on Boot, Runtime, and File Handling. I'll be exploring:
- What happens when the CubeSat boots, which code runs first
- How code is stored, updated, and reloaded (over the air or on reboot), and how are the files stored and accessed, what formats and structures are used.
- Where logs, sensor readings, or payload data are stored in memory or flash
- How the system handles corrupted files or incomplete logs, and how to prevent data loss or corrupted states
